One regular day, I was asked this question:

>"Tell us about one phenomenal thing you have done in your life and how does it change your perspective?"

There are too many fantastic things happened in my life, hence difficult to choose. Let me go with one of the most recent events, when I enjoyed my first Hackathon ever.

The past me only thought about teamwork as merely working in a team, helping each other and together reaching the very final goal. That version of mine was result-driven and continuously pushed others to achieve the nearly impossible perfection.

During and after that Hackathon, my perspective about doing things in a team changed drastically. It was not and should not be limited into the sole idea of achieving the final goal together, nor doing anything to accomplish that very goal. Apart from that, it is to support, to love each other member and to act like a whole. And by supporting others, I meant both mentally and physically.

Ultimately, it is my belief that working tirelessly to achieve a particular checkpoint should not be the characteristic of a productive team alone. They also need to work creatively and prioritize their backlog logically. Together with the ability to collaborate between members, those essential characteristics would lead a team towards their final goal.
