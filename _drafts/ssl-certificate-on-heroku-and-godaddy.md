The story starts in a nice morning, when we received an urgent message from our client:

> Site down... SSL problems! Need to renew it ASAP!

So the mission is clear:

- Renew our SSL Certificate on Namecheap (where we purchased our SSL Certificates)
- Update the application on Heroku with our newly renewed SSL.

I and my pair [Quang Le](http://vn.linkedin.com/pub/nhat-quang-le-nguyen/3a/b69/592) have gone through too much of a hassle to config this, thus we would love to share our experience to help others.
