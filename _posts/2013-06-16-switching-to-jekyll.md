There're many reasons why I wanted to switch my blog back-end to [Jekyll](http://Jekyllrb.com). One main reason is that I love [**Git**](http://git-scm.com), even want to do almost anything in my life with **Git** (well, *almost*). And Jekyll does just that.

The speed of static HTML website is another reason. This [2-second loading time](http://blog.kissmetric.com/loading-time/) fact comparing to my old Wordpress site 7-second loading time (cached already) is just-not-right. And this site loads for just [578ms](http://tools.pingdom.com/fpt/#!/jHE3s/http://tklarryonline.github.io).

I'm using a modified version of Scribble, the Jekyll theme, a nice theme to start-up. You can easily [get it on GitHub](http://github.com/muan/scribble). However, a new home needs some clean-up. So here are my to-dos:

* <s>Create my own logo using CSS3;</s>
* <s>Increase font-size and line-height to my own needs;</s>
* <s>Modify the hyperlink appearance;</s>
* Modify the menu bar;
* <s>Modify the container, blockquote and codeblock;</s>
* Modify the page navigation;
* Modify 404 error page;
* Customize my footer;

Apart from that, listening to this selected list of [Pop music for June](http://mp3.zing.vn/album/Nhac-Hot-US-UK-Thang-06-2013-Various-Artists/ZWZAB7EW.html).
